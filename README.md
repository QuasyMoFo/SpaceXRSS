The rockets currently in use are:
* Falcon 9 - Stage 1
* Falcon 9 - Stage 2

Treat the main repository folder as the Script folder, or the Archive.
Just drag and drop these 3 folders into script, and you'll be able to select F9.ks on the boot file, then just change your mission parameters in the F9_Launch_Orbit file, and you'll be on your way!

## Features In The Codebase
In the current version of the codebase, you can find multiple features on top of the standard launch sequence.
When opening the Telemetry kOS Terminal, you'll see the T- countdown, fuel on board, time in KSP, and some other data points which all you *nerds* can enjoy to look at.

During the countdown procedure, you'll see things being printed onto the console such as: "Fuel Load Start".
After reading through this site [here](https://spaceflight101.com/falcon-9-countdown-timeline/), I've listed all of the events on the T-Clock, and all the way from L-8:30:00 (If you choose to set the countdown this far back that is).

__**Listed Features**__ as of 28/04/2021 (Version 0.1.0)
* Countdown Sequence with chosen timer
* Max Q Throttling
* Throttle Down for MECO
* Stage Seperation Events, with the Landing Script activation
* Guidance to orbit
* Payload Deployment

After all these events, the script ends.

__**Upcoming Features**__
* Dragon Capsule Procedures
* Falcon Heavy Flight Software
* First stage script improvements & optimisations
* Guidance computer improvements & optimisations
